How to reproduce figure 1 in Thawornwattana1 et al. 2021.

When you run the program, it will ask you to input the 
per-read per-base error rate 
Type a value and hit Enter.

If you run the program multiple times, using the values 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 
the program will create summary results in the files 
genotypecallingerror_e0.1.txt, genotypecallingerror_e0.05.txt, etc.

Then you can use the r code genotypecall-plot.r to reproduce our figure 1.

If you use other values, the C program will be fine, but the R code needs to be edited to 
use the correct file names and axis labels etc.
